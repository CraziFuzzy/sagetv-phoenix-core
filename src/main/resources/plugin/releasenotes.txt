4.1 Build for Sage7
* Phoenix version now bumped to 2.0 to reflect lots of small api changes and the addition of metadata and fanart core code.
* Phoenix now owns all scrapers and Metadata Parsers
* Removed MyMovies since it was not being used
* Updated MetadataAPIs to support searches, lookups, updates, etc
* Added a default 10 second timeout for all URL connections (ie, for fanart downloading, etc, so that it would not block forever)
* Added Phoenix Configuration to the SageTV plugin configuration
* Now uses Sage7 MetadataAPIs for reading/writing metadata
* Now uses Sage7 events for automatic lookups (mediafile imported and recording completed)
* Will not attempt to find metadata simply by tuning to a channel
* Removed many configuration options as it relates to overwriting metadata fanart
  - Will never overwrite metadata when doing an automatic lookup
* Property files are no longer created, ever, since Sage7 provides direct APIs for setting metadata values
* Fixed bugs in the imdb scraper for writers, directors, etc
* Upgraded tmdb movies to the 2.1 api
* Fixed year issue when looking for best match against a year
* TV guest stars are stored in "Guests" not "Actors"
* Added flag to prevent updating metadata for recordings
